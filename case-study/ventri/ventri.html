                        <h4>Project Brief</h4>
                        <p>The world is evolving around the internet and digital solutions. 
                            Individuals and firms are swifting towards buying and selling 
                            things over the internet. Selling online can help a business 
                            reach new markets and increase sales and revenue. Searching for 
                            products and services online can save time and money by, 
                            allowing one to find the best prices without having to do all 
                            the legwork. Thus, this project.</p>

                        <h4>Why Ventri</h4>
                        <p>Ventri is an E-commercce application that connects buyers and sellers 
                            together, and supports information exchange between them. Ventri 
                            saves the buyers the stress of legwork in searching and buying a 
                            product, thereby overcoming the barrier of distance and ttime. It 
                            is aso a platform where merchants (business owners) create awareness 
                            of their business, reach a wider market and maxmize business profit.</p>

        <section class="bussiness-opportunity">
            <h2>Business Opportunity</h2>
            <div class="paragraph-group">
                <p>Ventri focuses on connecting buyers and sellers that are within a close rane of distance. 
                    Therefore, it will not be competing with other e-commerce brands, where buyers and  
                    sellers from different locations, both far and near are connected together. In Ventri, 
                    the buyer can easily see the different stores around his area, their respective proximity 
                    range to his location and their available products. This provides the buyer with the choice 
                    of either requesting a delivery or easily picking up the product from the store.</p>

                <p>Only a few competitors exist in the market as the concept is relatively new and this increases 
                    the chances of the application to outshine the others, thereby creating a business opportunity 
                    and eventually generating revenue.</p>

                            the already existing system of buying and selling online. In the

                            user interviews, Empathy map and user persona.

                            two customers. The aim was to understand what motivates them and 
                            frustrates them about buying and selling products online.

                        <p>Everyday, we keep adjusting towards a stress-free lifestyle. Nobody wants 
                            to go through the stress of moving from one shop to the other searching 
                            for a particular product or thinking of how to get the product. Ventri 
                            saves one that stress and also helps merchants/shop owners in creating 
                            awareness for their business, thus creating and maintaining an online 
                            presence for them.
                        </p>
                        <p>As almost everything is done over the internet, there is also the need for 
                            security of privacy to be ensured and online verification of every account 
                            even in e-commerce business. And this wraps it up.
