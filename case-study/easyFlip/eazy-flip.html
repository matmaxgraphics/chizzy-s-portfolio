                <p>EasyFlip is a reliable and secure exchange platform for trading gift cards and bitcoin. 
                    In my research, I found out it has quite many competitors and I identified their 
                    marketing strategies, technologies and also the overall user experience of these 
                    competitors. Following the analysis of my research, I was able to come up with a solid 
                    marketing strategy and technology by creating and validating design solutions. I also 
                    worked on providing a simplified and easy-to-use and navigate interface, so as to yield 
                    an exciting and great user experience.
                </p>

                <p>The app uses state-of-the-art procedures for all transactions, hence reflecting payments 
                    within few minutes. Also, the app is able to secure all transactions through a professionally 
                    audited exchange system with encryption.
                </p>

                <p>In summary, Easyflip serves as a middleman between those who have gift cards they do not need 
                    and those who need gift cards they do not have.

                    <p>The objectives I set out to achieve in the course of this project include:</p>

                </div>
            </div>


            <div class="user-research">
                <h2>User Research</h2>
                <p>First, I carried out a general research on gift cards and bitcoin, and how their trading works 
                    before proceeding to the user research in order to understand the users better, their pains, 
                    frustration and goals.
                </p>

                <p>Gift cards are alternative payment to cash for purchases within a particular store or related 
                    businesses. They are issued by a particular company or brand and are activated upon purchase, 
                    so they don’t need to be activated by the recipient. Gift card essentially works as a marketing 
                    tool for different brands in the customer’s pocket and also allows for partial redemption, 
                    leaving the rest of the balance stored on the gift card and eliminating cash backs.
                </p>
                
                <p>Next, I carried out the user research by mapping out a discussion guide with a Q/A session and 
                    moderated interviews with friends and a group of persons, who are into the crypto industry and 
                    also do online trades. These groups formed my participants for the user research.
                </p>
                <p>From the Interview and Q/A session conducted, I observed that;</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><img src="../../assets/images/bullet-list.png" alt="bullet list icon" class="list-img">About 90% of the participants interviewed falls within the range of 20 - 30 years while, the remaining percentage are above 30 years</li>
                    <li><img src="../../assets/images/bullet-list.png" alt="bullet list icon" class="list-img">85% of the participants are male while 15% are female.</li>
                    <li><img src="../../assets/images/bullet-list.png" alt="bullet list icon" class="list-img">About 70% of the participants love to trade online because of the seamless transaction and les stress involved.</li>
                    <li><img src="../../assets/images/bullet-list.png" alt="bullet list icon" class="list-img">Over 50% of the participants pointed out that, the risks of trading on an insecure platform could be very terrible</li>
                    <li><img src="../../assets/images/bullet-list.png" alt="bullet list icon" class="list-img">Almost 90% of the participants prefer to trade bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies using paxful wallet</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>The Key Findings</h2>
                <p>From the user research, the key challenge of the user is deduced as follows;</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><img src="../../assets/images/bullet-list.png" alt="bullet list icon" class="list-img">Poor Management Of Account: The users do not wat a system that is not properly secured and managed, which could lead to their individual accounts being hacked.</li>
                    <li><img src="../../assets/images/bullet-list.png" alt="bullet list icon" class="list-img">Complexity Of The System: Some of the exchange platforms are complex. Hence, users find it difficult to easily navigate through the system.</li>

            <p>This project was an interesting project with deep insights on how to give users a great experience while 
                using the app. It was also quite challenging as it stretched me beyond the scope of the project to 
                further understand the way gift card and bitcoin trading works with an insight into the overall 
                crypto field.</p>
